# ScienceQtech-Employee-Performance-Mapping
# Project Description
 * Generated reports on employee details, their performance, and on the project that the employees have undertaken, to analyze the employee database and extract specific data based on different requirements.
# Tasks performed
  * Created a database named employee, then inserted values from data_science_team.csv proj_table.csv and emp_record_table.csv into the employee database from the given resources.

  * Created an ER diagram for the given employee database.

  * Wrote a query to fetch EMP_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, GENDER, and DEPARTMENT from the employee record table, and made a list of employees and details of their department.

  * Wrote a nested query to find employees with experience of more than ten years.

  * Wrote a query to create a stored procedure to retrieve the details of the employees whose experience is more than three years.

  * Wrote a query using stored functions in the project table to check whether the job profile assigned to each employee in the data science team matches the organization’s set standard:

    * The standard being:

      * For an employee with experience less than or equal to 2 years assign 'JUNIOR DATA SCIENTIST'
      * For an employee with the experience of 2 to 5 years assign 'ASSOCIATE DATA SCIENTIST'
      * For an employee with the experience of 5 to 10 years assign 'SENIOR DATA SCIENTIST'
      * For an employee with the experience of 10 to 12 years assign 'LEAD DATA SCIENTIST'
      * For an employee with the experience of 12 to 16 years assign 'MANAGER'
  * Created an index to improve the cost and performance of the query to find the employee whose FIRST_NAME is ‘Eric’ in the employee table after checking the execution plan.
